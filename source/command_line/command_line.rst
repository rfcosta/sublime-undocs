Command Line Usage
==================

Sublime Text includes a command-line helper called ``subl``.
Using the command-line helper,
you can open files and folders
and perform other actions
from the command line.

Before using ``subl``, make sure
it is on your ``PATH``.
To put ``subl`` on your ``PATH``,
you may need to add directories to ``PATH``
or use symbolic links.

Also you can define an alias to the full path to the subl program file:

``alias subl='/Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl'``

Note the space on "Sublime Text" 
needs to be escaped with character "\\".

This alias command can be added
to your .profile or .bashrc
